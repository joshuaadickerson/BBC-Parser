The gist of it all is that I don't care what you do with this or how you use it. I don't even care if you credit me for
it. Apparently I can't release it in the public domain without a license so here it is.

The parts from Elkarte and SMF are licensed under the BSD-3 clause. See the file headers of those files for more info on
that. Since my work is a derivative of that, I need to license those files under the same license. So, the test app is
mine and the parsers are derived from Elkarte/SMF.
